This repository contains an implementation of a Deep Operator Network (DeepONet) in TensorFlow to solve the Helmholtz equation, a fundamental partial differential equation (PDE) that arises in various fields such as acoustics, electromagnetism, and fluid dynamics.

Repository Contents:

BranchNet: A neural network that encodes the input function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) (source term) at various sensor points.
TrunkNet: A neural network that encodes the spatial coordinates 
𝑥
x and potentially temporal coordinates 
𝑡
t where the solution 
𝑢
(
𝑥
)
u(x) is evaluated.
DeepONet: A combined model that takes the outputs of both BranchNet and TrunkNet to predict the solution of the Helmholtz equation given an input function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x).
Training Loop: The code includes a training loop that optimizes the model using synthetic data generated for a simple sine function.
Test and Evaluation: The code also includes a section that generates test data, predicts the solution using the trained model, and compares the predictions against true values.
Helmholtz Equation:

 u(x)=f(x)
where 
Δ
Δ is the Laplacian operator, 
𝑘
k is the wave number, and 
𝑓
(

)
f(x) is the source term.

How to Use
Training:

Run the script to train the DeepONet model on synthetic data representing the source term 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x) and its corresponding solution 
𝑢
(
𝑥
)
u(x).
The model uses a combination of BranchNet and TrunkNet to learn the mapping from the source term to the solution.
Testing:

The model is tested on a new set of inputs. The predictions made by the model are compared against the true solutions to evaluate its performance.
Results Analysis:

The script calculates the Mean Squared Error (MSE) between the predicted solutions and the true solutions on the test data, providing a quantitative measure of the model's accuracy.
Additionally, a side-by-side comparison of the predicted and true values is printed for each test point.
Results Analysis
After training the DeepONet model on synthetic data generated for the Helmholtz equation, the model was tested on a separate dataset. The following points summarize the results:

Mean Squared Error (MSE):

The MSE between the predicted solutions and the true solutions provides a measure of the model's accuracy. A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are close to the true values.
In this example, the MSE value gives an indication of how well the model generalizes to unseen data.
Comparison of Predictions:

The results include a direct comparison between the true solutions and the model's predictions at each test point. This allows for an intuitive understanding of how closely the model's output matches the expected values.
If the model is well-trained, the predicted values should closely follow the true values across the domain.
Interpretation:

The model's ability to predict the solution of the Helmholtz equation accurately demonstrates the potential of DeepONet for solving PDEs. However, the accuracy depends on factors such as the quality of the training data, the complexity of the function 
𝑓
(
𝑥
)
f(x), and the capacity of the neural networks used in BranchNet and TrunkNet.
Future Improvements:

Experiment with different network architectures, such as deeper networks or different activation functions, to potentially improve accuracy.
Use a more complex or real-world dataset to further validate the model's robustness.
Implement regularization techniques or data augmentation to prevent overfitting and improve generalization.
